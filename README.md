# SOLIRIUS-JAVA-CODING-EXERCISE
This is a solution to a coding excercise which i had to complete for a Junior Software Development position.

## SOLIRIUS JAVA CODING EXERCISE

Write a java program to turn on/off a set of coloured lights.

The number of lights should be configurable on the command line with a default value of 20.

The set of lights will be made up of a repeating set of colours in a fixed order (e.g red, green, white)

When you run the program, it should turn each light in the set on for 1 second and then turn it off.

The output of the program should be as follows:

12:00:01: Red Light On
12:00:02: Red Light Off
12:00:02: Green Light On
12:00:03: Green Light Off
12:00:03: White Light On
12:00:04: White Light Off
etc.
etc.

The sequence should continue in a loop until the program is interrupted.

Design the program so that it would be easy to modify the colours and the number of colours that make up the set of lights using object oriented techniques. 
(e.g. blue, red, yellow, white).
